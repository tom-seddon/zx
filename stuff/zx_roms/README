    This download contains

    zx82.txt  - source file for ZX Spectrum ROM.
    zx81.txt  - source file for ZX81 ROM.
    zx80.txt  - source file for ZX80 ROM.
    ace.txt   - source file for Jupiter Ace ROM.
    if1_1.txt - source file for original ZX Interface 1.
    if1_2.txt - source file for improved ZX Interface 1.
    u3.asm    - extra source file for an unusual ZX Spectrum Disassembler.
    sc01.txt  - source file for an experimental ZX Spectrum ROM.
    sc01.rom  - binary 16K ROM for the ZX Spectrum - Network and RS232 enhanced.
    sg81.rom  - binary 8K ROM for ZX81/TS-1000 - faster mathematics.
    gw03.txt  - source file for a usable variation of the standard 48K ROM.
    gw03.rom  - binary 16K ROM file from above source

    These files will assemble unaltered with the Telemark table-driven Assembler
    e.g.

    TASM -80 -b zx82.txt 

    produces a 16K ROM file zx82.obj which can be renamed as necessary.

    Copy this to zx82.rom and load it into an emulator.

    The files should require very little alteration to assemble using other
    cross-assemblers.

    The style of most of the files is unusual.  The labels generally take the 
    form of the letter L followed by the four-character address in hexadecimal.

    Above this is a pseudo label by which the routine is referred to in a wide 
    range of books and magazines.  Labels are as first designated by Dr. Ian 
    Logan, Dr. Frank O'Hara and Gianluca Carri.  In general, labels from the 
    ZX Spectrum have been applied backwards to the ZX81 and ZX80 even when the 
    labels for the original ZX81 Disassembly and original ZX80 source code 
    became known.  This is beneficial in that it reveals a quite remarkable 
    evolution.
